Software and Data Package Instructions for "Identifying Consumer-Welfare Changes when Online Search Platforms Change their Lists of Search Results" 

This folder contains the software and data needed to replicate the results from the paper "Identifying Consumer-Welfare Changes when Online Platforms Change their Lists of Search Results." In addition to this ReadMe.txt file, there are 4 items: train.csv, market1search.csv, WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.pdf and WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.Rmd. The file train.csv contains the original, full dataset from kaggle.com. This is (as of February 2020) freely accessible to anyone on kaggle.com. In particular, this data file can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection from https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-personalized-sort/data. Data was provided to Kaggle by Expedia for an online data science competition.

The file market1search.csv contains data on the largest market from train.csv. That is, while train.csv contains search impressions for bookings across many world locations, market1search.csv is focused on bookings available in one, large US location. Reduction of the dataset from train.csv to market1search.csv (and more) can be performed with the Rmarkdown file WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.Rmd.

The file WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.Rmd contains all the code needed to replicate all the results of "Identifying Consumer Welfare Changes when Online Platforms Change their Lists of Search Results" from either train.csv or market1search.csv. This file can be run from Rstudio or can be opened in your text editor of choice and the code snippets contained within can be copied and pasted into an R console. This file contains detailed instructions and descriptions around the code. You will need three R packages to execute the R code: (1) the tidyverse, (2) lubridate and (3) mlogit. Instructions to download these packages through cran are contained within WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.Rmd.

Finally, WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.pdf is the pdf that WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.Rmd can generate, after following the instructions within WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.Rmd. Namely, if one changes the "my_folder" line in the code chunk in section two to the location you have stored this software package directory and have installed the three packages listed above, clicking "knit" in R studio while WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.Rmd is open will generate WelfareSearchListingAnalysis.pdf. Be warned, this may take several hours, however, as the last three code chunks are computationally intensive to analyze.
